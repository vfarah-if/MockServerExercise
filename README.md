# Mocks Server POC
Setup a POC for  https://www.mocks-server.org/

## Low level requirements

1. Must utilise Typescript
2. Must represent some public API that may be easy to replicate so tests can compare with what has been generated
3. Must be tested with inputs and outputs and several variants of what can happen with that endpoint
4. Must be able to demonstrate the use of this to other developers to understand the benefit
